# NLP-Based Topic Modelling for Gym Review Analysis

This project applies Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to uncover key customer pain points in online gym reviews. By analyzing real-world customer feedback from Google and Trustpilot, we identify recurring negative experiences and generate actionable insights for improving customer satisfaction at a commerical fitness chain.

## Project Overview

- **Objective**: Identify common causes of negative sentiment in customer reviews and provide strategic recommendations to improve the gym experience.
- **Dataset**: Thousands of 1‚Äì2 star reviews from Google and Trustpilot across gym locations.
- **Approach**: Combined traditional and modern NLP techniques (LDA, BERTopic, and LLMs) with emotion detection to extract, cluster, and interpret dominant complaint themes.

## Key Methods & Techniques

### üîç Data Preprocessing
- Filtered reviews for negative sentiment (<3 stars)
- Removed duplicates and non-English reviews
- Standard text cleaning: lowercasing, punctuation, and brand removal

### Topic Modelling
- **BERTopic**: Identified interpretable topic clusters across multiple data subsets
- **LDA (Baseline)**: Used for benchmarking model interpretability
- **LLM-Assisted Topic Extraction**: Employed Mistral-7B Instruct for fine-grained insights

### Emotion Detection
- Fine-tuned `bert-base-uncased` model used to filter reviews flagged as ‚Äúanger‚Äù
- Focused topic modelling on emotionally charged complaints

## Results

- **Key pain points** identified:
  - Dirty or broken equipment
  - Poor customer service and rude staff
  - Overcrowding and gym access issues
  - Cold showers and air-conditioning failures
- **LLM-enhanced BERTopic** produced the most actionable and interpretable results
- **Actionable insights** included:
  - Improve equipment maintenance and cleaning protocols
  - Enhance staff training and professionalism
  - Redesign class schedules and gym layout for better crowd control
  - Simplify membership and pricing systems
